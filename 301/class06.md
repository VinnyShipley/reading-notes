# Node.JS and Pair Programming

## Node.JS

1. **What is node.js?** Node is a program used to that can be used to execute JavaScript in a browser.

2. **In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?** it is the engine that makes takes JavaSript prompts from a website and makes them readable to the native machine on the client's end.

## Pair Programming

1. **What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?** Greater efficiency, engaged collaboration, the ability to learn from fellow students, improved socail skills, job interview preparedness, and work environment readiness.

2. **In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?** Engaged collaboration has been the biggest thing for me in terms of what I have gotten out of pair programming in the past. I think the bouncing ideas off of each other leads to new and interesting coding solutions.

3. **How does pair programming work?** There is a driver and a navigator. The driver is the only one actually touching the code, and the navigator directs the driver what to type in. The navigator can also be the one that is researching how to solve a specific bug.
