# REST

## How I explained REST to my brother

1. ***Who is Roy Fielding?**  A guy that helped write the first web servers and did research on why the web works the way it does.

2. **Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?** Because the techniques today are used primarily to get information off of a small amount of machines.

3. **What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?** The HTTP protocol applies the right 'verbs' to the right 'nouns' in a request to a site. In this case verb would be an action being applied to the nouns, which would here mean URL.

4. **What does a GET do?** It requests information from the specific database to be displayed on the webpage.

5. **What does a POST do?** POST is the process of one system adding something to another system

6. **What does PUT do?** Put is the process f a system replacing something in another system.

7. **What does PATCH do?** PATCH is similar to PUT, but is only a partial update.
