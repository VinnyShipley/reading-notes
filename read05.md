# CSS and the Joys of Style

## **What CSS Does**

Think of CSS as the paint, window dressing, and general aesthetic of a house, while HTML is the structural load bearing elements of a house. Yes it is perfectly legal to live in a house with no paint or aesthetic elements. But is that house really worth living in?

CSS makes websites engaging and easy to digest from a user point of view, and user engagement translates to more web traffic, which translates to more money if you are selling any sort of product on the site. You know, if you like that sort of thing

## **CSS in Practice**

The basic premise of using CSS is selecting an HTML element that you have already coded, and manipulating the look of that element. That is why it is so important to have good semantics within your HTML code. By giving a good understanding of what is where on the page within the HTML code, it is much easier to pick which specific element you want to manipulate in CSS.

In my own experience CSS is very much based off a trial and error system. Input a value and see how it affects the output, tweak from there until it fits

## **Example Code**

section.ham img{

    border: solid white;
    border-width: 3px;
    width: 750px;
