# Duckett Reading #1

## **Summary**

This reading section was for the most part review of what I learned in 102, but with a couple inssights that helped me understand some of the concepts a little better.

## **HTML and CSS Reading**

There were a couple new tags presented in this section of the reading, some that I don't fully understand (see the Things I wasnt to learn more about section), and some that I feel like I got a good handle on. Of the ones that I feel somewhat confident about is the Iframes tag. Essentially it opens up a window in your HTML page where you can anchor another site, usually Google Maps, so the user can see and interact with it.

I also didn't realize that there were steps one should take before even getting to the point of wireframing. Those steps are:

1. Breakdown who would be visiting the site you are constructing

2. Breakdown why those people are visiting your site

3. Breakdown what level and what kind of engagement that these people want from your site

4. Breakdown how often these people are visiting your site

5. Construct a sitemap to help you think out how the wireframing should be constructed

## **JavaScript Reading**

Also with this reading I found a lot of it to be review of 102, but with a more big picture look at it that I wouldn't have been able to grasp before learning the most basic scripting knowledge. These large concepts are:

**Steps of writing a script**

1. Define the goal of the script.
    * Identify what specifically this script should do with the user input

2. Design the script
    * Split what you need the script to do into a series of tasks
    * Use a flowchart to help you visualize what those tasks are and in what order they need to be done
    * Code each of these steps

**Events, Methods, and Properties**

* **Events**
  * Events are the user input to the website. This triggers something to happen if there is a script written

* **Methods**
  * Methods are that something. When an input is recieved from the user, the script is invoked and executes in the console

* **Properties**
  * The value of the object is now changed and the script has run it's course

## **Things I want to know more about**

* A couple times during the reading Duckett talks about how some people are writing code in HTML5 while it is still being created. I'm interestyed how someone writes code in a language that is actively being updated.
* I don't fully understand the concept of the figure tag, it seems kind of like a nav tag that is just for images? Maybe it allows for easier classification on the CSS side of things?
