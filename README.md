## Growth Mindset
As I understand it, growth midset is the understanding that knowledge and intelligence is dynamic. With this dynamci understanding, one can change problems and challenges into opportunities to learn and grow.
### Reminders
* Follow any thought of I don't know or I don't understand with *'yet'*
* Understand and trust in the process of the **Learning Pit**
* Stay positive! Everything is a process, and no one started out kowing anything about anything. Celebrate in the success of others and let it inspire your own success
