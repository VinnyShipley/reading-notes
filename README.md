## Bio

## Growth Mindset
As I understand it, growth midset is the understanding that knowledge and intelligence is dynamic. With this dynamic understanding, one can change problems and challenges into opportunities to learn and grow.
### Reminders when thinking about Growth Mindset
* Follow any thought of I don't know or I don't understand with *'yet'* 
    - I don't understand this concept... yet
* Understand and trust in the process of the **Learning Pit**

* Stay positive! Learning is a process, and no one started out kowing anything about anything. Celebrate in the success of others and let it inspire your own success
