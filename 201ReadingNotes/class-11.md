# Audio, Video, and Images

## Images

**Repeating Images in CSS**

There are a couple ways to repeat images in CSS

* Repeat: the background image is repeated horizontally and vertically.

* Repeat-x: the image is only repeated horizontally

* Repeat-y the image is only repeated vertically

* No-repeat: the image is not repeated

**Background position**

When an image isn't being repeated in the background, you can position it anywhere you would like it on the page using bottom, top, left, right, and center direction values

## Video and Audio APIs

**Embedding audio and video in HTML**

When embedding audio and video in HTML, you use the ```<video>``` and ```<audio>``` tags respectively. Within the opening and closing tags of them you put the source, alt text and potential links to easier supported video players.
