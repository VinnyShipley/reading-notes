# Images, Color, Text

The long and short of this reading is how to format your pages visually, bot in CSS and HTML.

## Images

### Placing an Image

* Before a paragraph:
  * The paragraph starts on a new line after the image

* Inside the start of a paragraph:
  * The first row of the text aligns with the bottom of the image

* In the middle of a paragraph:
  * The image is placed between the words on the paragraph that it appears in

### Three Rules for Creating Images

* Save images in the right format
  * Use .jpg .png or .gif

* Save them as the right size
  * Save it as the height and width you want it seen on the website

* Measure the image in pixels

## Color

### Opacity

Opacity is the value of how opaque an elements is, on a scale from 0 to 1, 1 being completely opaque

### Contrast

Contrast is the difference in color between foreground and background colors in the same element, or even surrounding elements

## Text

### Typeface Terminology

Serif font: Fonts that have extra details on the end of main strokes of letter. These strokes are known as serifs

Sans-serif font: Fonts that omit serifs

Monospace font: Fonts where each letter has the same width

Font Family: Property in CSS that allows you to specify the typeface that should be used for any text inside the element to which the rule applies

## JPEG vs. PNG vs. GIF

**JPEG**: Most useful when the image is a natural scene or photograph the variation in color and intensity is smooth

**PNG**: Most useful when the image needs transparency or for images with text or objects in them with sharp contrast edges like logos

**GIF**: Used when an image contains animations
