# Practicing in the Terminal

## Command Line

A lot of this section was review, but one interesting point that was brought up was the fact that some people run without a GUI at all. I feel like that would be a cool thing to try to get to at some point in the future, if not just for the reason that it would force you to really understand where your files are, and how to navigate to them. I think that that could be a cool way to interact with your data, and keep your programming chops sharp.

## Basic Navigation

As embarrassing as it is, I didn't know the exact difference between absolute and relative path and absolute path. Thinking about it now makes sense, relative being the path from where you are now, absolute being form the root directory.

## More About Files

I didn't realize that you could use quotes or a backslash to name a file in linux multiple words. Honestly going forward though I think I will still stick with camel or snake case when naming my files.

## Manual Pages

The manual pages are an absolute game changer. I had absolutely no idea that this kind of cheat sheet situation was available in the system itself. I think tis is going to be quite helpful for the future, especially with the GUI-less goal that I have set for myself above.

## Things I would like to know

* What are the restricted files on my own computer when I go to /var/logs? I would assume maybe confidential files that are maybe being pulled from the internet? I am a little unclear on that though.
