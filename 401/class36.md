## Whiteboard Interviews

When in a whiteboard interview, the biggest thing is to communicate at every step of the process. This will allow you some wiggle room if you get the problem wrong, the interviewer will at least see how you think an problem solve. Things to ask questions about during the interview:

* Restating the question

* Edge Cases

* Test Cases

* If the pseudocode you are writing makes sense to the interviewer

* General questions if you get stuck
