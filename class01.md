# Learning Markdown #

## **The Basics** ##

While it is similar to HTML, the Markdown language seems to streamline a lot of what HTML tries to do.

For example I made **this** word bold with nothing more than two asterisks on either side of the word with no spaces in between. *Wow, what an impressive technique! Oh my god! Is this all in italics simply by putting an aasterisk on either end of what you want selcted?*

***Thats exactly what I'm saying, and now this is combining both of those effects with now three asterisks***

But what if I have a bunch of datapoints that I need to put into an:

* Ordered list

* Unordered iist

* And a third thing?

Just simply put an asterisk soaced from the line above and below it, as well as before you say what you are putting in an unordered list. But what if you order not only in the court, but as a list style as well?

1. Just replace those asterisks with the appropriate number

2. Keep on putting spaces in between the lines of code so the output is nice and pretty

3. And really keep looking for that third thing I mentioned in the unordered list. I know I put it here somewhere
